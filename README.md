# Habitur

A habit tracker that promotes gradual, consistent, and shared growth.

## Gradual Growth

Growth with Habitur is gradual, from completing a habit once a month, to once a week, to daily. We'll handle this for you with auto-growth, but you can disable this and easily manage the habit yourself. (coming soon)

## Consistency

The "consistency" of your growth will stem from your Habitur rating, a metric that nicely tracks your progress with your habits. The more consistent you are, the more Habitur rating you gain from each habit completion.

You will be motivated to grow your Habitur rating, but more importantly, to grow yourself.
